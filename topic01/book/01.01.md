#Web 2.0 services

Web 2.0 technologies facilitated the change from static web sites with little interaction and user input to the current sites that allow users to upload, interact, post, comment and create content on a website.

Web 2.0 are now the norm whether it is for discovering new content through search engines, uploading personal content, commenting on existing content, reviewing services, facilitating buying and selling or just communicating over the web.

The work you do in this lab is to be documented in Moodle in the Journal named Lab1.
